# Bounding Box Concatenation

This app provides a utility for OCR bounding box concatenation. By concatenating all of the bounding boxes in a given frame, we
can treat each frame as a single document for OCR - giving us much more flexibility in terms of reading order algorithm implementations.

Within an OCR pipeline, this app ideally should be run between text detection (bounding box drawing) and the optical character recognition itself.
